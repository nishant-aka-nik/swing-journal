### Notes
 - need to find how to write postgres rules

 - add a user in the table which is like super user we will send a jwt in request which authenticate it as a super user and it will have access to all the records this my go app will use to create alerts and computations

 - and rest all users will have access to his own records only

 - need to find what does this auth.uid() and auth is based on these parameters we will create for users
